## DDD

**Domain-Driven Design** — a software design approach centered on domain modeling. The team builds a shared model of the business domain using a precise, agreed-upon language.

**Also see**: [Bounded Context](#bounded-context), [Ubiquitous Language](#ubiquitous-language)

---

## Bounded Context

An **explicit boundary** around a domain model with its own ubiquitous language. Inside the boundary, terms have precise meanings. "Account" in Banking may differ from "Account" in CRM — bounded contexts resolve this.

**Also see**: [DDD](#ddd), [Ubiquitous Language](#ubiquitous-language)

---

## Ubiquitous Language

A **shared, precise terminology** between developers and domain experts within a bounded context. The same word means the same thing to everyone — no translation gaps.

**Also see**: [DDD](#ddd), [Bounded Context](#bounded-context) · [Fintech: Financial States](fintech.md#financial-states)

---

## Strangler Fig

An **incremental migration pattern** — gradually replace a legacy system by building new functionality around it until the old system is "strangled" and can be removed. Named after the fig tree that grows around a host tree.

**Also see**: [Anti-Corruption Layer](#anti-corruption-layer)

---

## Anti-Corruption Layer

A **translation layer** that protects a bounded context from external model corruption. Translates between the external model and the internal domain model so neither leaks into the other.

**Also see**: [Bounded Context](#bounded-context), [Strangler Fig](#strangler-fig)

---

## Sidecar Pattern

A **co-located helper container** that supports the main application. Deployed alongside in the same pod (Kubernetes). Example: Envoy proxy handling TLS, routing, and observability for the app container.

**Also see**: [Ambassador Pattern](#ambassador-pattern)

---

## Ambassador Pattern

A **proxy service** that handles connectivity concerns (retry, routing, authentication) on behalf of the main service. Offloads cross-cutting network concerns from the application.

**Also see**: [Sidecar Pattern](#sidecar-pattern)

---

## Competing Consumers

Multiple consumers **pull from a single queue** for load-balanced processing. If one consumer is slow, others pick up the slack. Core pattern for scaling message processing horizontally.

**Also see**: [Messaging](messaging.md)

---

## Claim Check

Store a **large payload in external storage** and pass only a reference (the "claim check") in the message. Avoids bloating message brokers with large payloads.

**Also see**: [Messaging](messaging.md)

---

## Blue-Green

Two **identical environments** — Blue (current) and Green (new version). Traffic is switched from Blue to Green for zero-downtime deployments. Rollback is instant: switch back to Blue.

**Also see**: [Canary Deployment](#canary-deployment)

---

## Canary Deployment

Route a **small percentage of traffic** to the new version before full rollout. If error rates spike, the canary is killed and traffic reverts. Safer than Blue-Green for high-risk changes.

**Also see**: [Blue-Green](#blue-green)

---

## Well-Architected Framework

Azure's **five pillars** of architectural excellence:

| Pillar | Focus |
|:---|:---|
| **Reliability** | Recover from failures, high availability |
| **Security** | Protect data, identities, and infrastructure |
| **Cost Optimization** | Maximize value, minimize waste |
| **Operational Excellence** | Run and monitor systems in production |
| **Performance Efficiency** | Adapt to changing workload demands |

**Also see**: [CAF](#caf)

---

## CAF

**Cloud Adoption Framework** — Microsoft's structured methodology for cloud adoption: Strategy → Plan → Ready → Adopt → Govern → Manage.

**Also see**: [Well-Architected Framework](#well-architected-framework)

---

## Hub-and-Spoke

A **network topology** where a central hub VNet hosts shared services (firewall, gateway, DNS) and spoke VNets host workloads. All spoke-to-spoke traffic routes through the hub for inspection and control.

**Also see**: [Azure Services: VNet](azure-services.md#vnet)

---

## DMZ

**Demilitarized Zone** — an isolated network segment between the untrusted internet and trusted internal network. Hosts internet-facing services that should not have direct access to internal systems.

**Also see**: [Azure Services: Azure Firewall](azure-services.md#azure-firewall)
