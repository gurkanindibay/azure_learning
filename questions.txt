Question 8:
You are deploying an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template that includes a virtual network (VNet) and several subnets. You want to ensure that the subnets are created only if the VNet is successfully deployed. Which of the following ARM template features should you use to achieve this dependency?

reference()

Explanation
The 'reference()' function in an ARM template is used to retrieve information about another resource in the template. While 'reference()' can be useful for accessing properties of existing resources, it does not provide a way to enforce dependencies between resources like the 'dependsOn' feature does.
Your answer is correct
dependsOn

Explanation
The 'dependsOn' feature in an ARM template allows you to specify dependencies between resources. By using 'dependsOn', you can ensure that the creation of subnets is dependent on the successful deployment of the virtual network (VNet). This ensures that the subnets are only created after the VNet has been successfully deployed.
conditions

Explanation
The 'conditions' feature in an ARM template is used to conditionally deploy resources based on certain criteria. While 'conditions' can be useful for controlling when resources are deployed, it does not provide a way to enforce dependencies between resources like the 'dependsOn' feature does.
copy

Explanation
The 'copy' feature in an ARM template is used for iterating over a resource definition multiple times with different values. It is not directly related to specifying dependencies between resources, so it is not the appropriate feature to use in this scenario where you want to ensure that subnets are created only after the VNet is successfully deployed.

Which of the following metrics affect how much an Azure Redis Cache instance costs?
Your answer is correct
Region, pricing tier, hours
Region, Consumed storage, pricing tier
Per transaction
Region, Pricing tier
Overall explanation
Redis Cache is charged by the hour, and varies by region. It also depends on the tier you choose. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cache/


You are developing a web application that uses Azure Cosmos DB to store user data. You need to ensure that the application can handle high availability and low latency access to the data across multiple regions. Which of the following configurations should you choose when creating your Azure Cosmos DB account?

Your answer is incorrect
Create a multi-region account with write regions in multiple locations.

Explanation
Creating a multi-region account with write regions in multiple locations allows for write operations to be distributed across different regions, but it does not address the need for read operations to be performed with low latency across multiple regions. This configuration may improve write performance but does not optimize read performance for users accessing the application from different locations.
Create a single-region account and enable multi-master replication.

Explanation
Creating a single-region account with multi-master replication allows for writes to be made in multiple regions, but it does not provide the high availability and low latency access across multiple regions that is required for this scenario. Multi-master replication only enables write operations in multiple regions, not read operations.
Correct answer
Create a multi-region account with read replicas in different regions.

Explanation
Creating a multi-region account with read replicas in different regions ensures high availability and low latency access to the data across multiple regions. This configuration allows for read operations to be performed locally in each region, reducing latency and improving performance for users accessing the application from different locations.
Create a single-region account and configure it to use strong consistency.

Explanation
Creating a single-region account and configuring it to use strong consistency may provide data consistency within that region, but it does not address the requirement for high availability and low latency access across multiple regions. Strong consistency does not guarantee that data will be available in all regions or that read operations will be optimized for performance.
