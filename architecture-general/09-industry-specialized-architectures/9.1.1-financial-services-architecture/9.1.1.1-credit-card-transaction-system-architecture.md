# 9.1.1.1 Credit Card Transaction System Architecture

## Overview

Credit Card Transaction System Architecture defines the end-to-end flow of payment card transactions, from the moment a cardholder initiates a payment to the final settlement between financial institutions. This architecture must handle millions of transactions per day with sub-second response times while maintaining the highest levels of security and compliance.

## Clearing and Settlement

**Clearing** and **Settlement** are two distinct but interconnected processes that occur after a financial transaction (like a credit card payment) is executed.

### What is Clearing?

**Clearing** is the process of **reconciling and validating** a transaction between parties before the actual transfer of funds occurs.

**What happens during clearing:**
- Confirms the details of the trade (amount, parties involved, transaction type)
- Calculates the obligations of each party (who owes what to whom)
- Nets multiple transactions to reduce the number of actual transfers needed
- Manages counterparty risk (ensures both parties can fulfill their obligations)

**Example:** After you make a purchase, the clearinghouse verifies that the merchant submitted the transaction correctly and calculates what the issuing bank owes.

### What is Settlement?

**Settlement** is the **actual transfer** of funds between parties—the final step where the transaction is completed.

**What happens during settlement:**
- The merchant receives payment (minus fees)
- The cardholder's account is debited
- Ownership of funds is officially transferred
- The transaction is finalized and irrevocable

**Example:** The funds are transferred from your issuing bank through the network to the acquiring bank, which then deposits into the merchant's account.

### Clearing vs Settlement: Key Differences

| Aspect | Clearing | Settlement |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Purpose** | Validate & reconcile transactions | Execute the actual fund transfer |
| **Timing** | Happens first (T+0 to T+1) | Happens after clearing (T+1 to T+2) |
| **Risk** | Manages counterparty risk | Eliminates counterparty risk |
| **Output** | Confirmed obligations & net positions | Completed fund transfers |
| **Frequency** | Batch processing (end of day) | Scheduled settlement windows |

### Why This Two-Step Process?

- **Risk Reduction:** Clearinghouses and networks act as intermediaries, guaranteeing transactions even if one party defaults
- **Efficiency:** Netting reduces millions of individual transactions to net positions, minimizing actual fund movements
- **Trust:** Merchants and cardholders can transact without directly trusting each other
- **Cost Reduction:** Fewer actual transfers means lower banking and wire fees

### Phase Breakdown

#### **Day 0 - Transaction & Authorization Phase**

**1. Transaction Occurs (10:00 AM)**
- Customer presents card at merchant POS terminal
- Transaction details captured (amount, merchant ID, card number)
- Transaction data encrypted and prepared for authorization

**2. Authorization - Real-time (10:05 AM - within seconds)**
- Payment gateway sends authorization request to acquirer
- Request routed through card network (Visa/Mastercard) to issuing bank
- Issuer performs:
  - **Balance check:** Does cardholder have available credit/funds?
  - **Fraud screening:** Does this match cardholder's spending pattern?
  - **Risk assessment:** Apply velocity checks, geographic limits
- Response sent back (Approved/Declined) with authorization code
- **Result:** Funds are "held" on customer's account, but NOT yet transferred
- Merchant has **authorization** but hasn't been paid yet

> **💡 How Limit Checks Work Before Settlement**
> 
> Credit limits are enforced **during authorization**, not settlement. The issuer tracks two buckets:
> 
> **Example Scenario:**
> - Total Credit Limit: **$5,000**
> - Settled Balance (from previous days): **$2,000**
> - Pending Authorizations (today's holds): **$500**
> - **Available Credit = $5,000 - $2,000 - $500 = $2,500**
> 
> **When you attempt a $600 purchase:**
> 1. Issuer checks: $2,500 (available) ≥ $600 (new transaction) ✅ **Approved**
> 2. Creates **authorization hold** for $600 immediately
> 3. Available credit drops to: $1,900 (even though settlement hasn't happened)
> 
> **Timeline of Credit Tracking:**
> 
> | Stage | Available Credit | Money Movement |
> |-------|-----------------|----------------|
> | Before transaction | $2,500 | None |
> | Authorization (Day 0) | $1,900 (hold placed) | None - just reservation |
> | Clearing (Day 1) | $1,900 (hold still active) | None - data processing |
> | Settlement (Day 2) | Hold → Settled charge | **Now** $600 moves between banks |
> | After settlement | Settled balance: $2,600 | Complete |
> 
> **Key Insight:** Authorization creates an **immediate reservation** against your limit. Settlement (2 days later) is just the actual fund movement between banks. This prevents overspending even though settlement is delayed.

**3. Merchant Batch Close (11:00 PM)**
- Merchant's POS system closes daily batch
- All day's authorized transactions bundled into a settlement file
- Batch file sent to payment processor/acquirer
- **This triggers the clearing process** - merchant is now requesting payment
- Authorizations become "captures" (actual charges vs. holds)

```

**4. Clearing Files Sent (2:00 AM)** - *Performed by: Acquiring Bank & Card Network*
- **Acquiring Bank:**
  - Aggregates batch files from all merchants
  - Validates batch integrity and data quality
  - Formats data into standardized ISO 8583 clearing messages
  - Submits consolidated clearing file to Card Network
- **Card Network (Visa/Mastercard):**
  - Receives clearing files from all acquiring banks
  - Routes transactions to appropriate issuing banks based on card BIN
  - Delivers clearing records to each issuing bank
- **Issuing Bank:**
  - Receives clearing records for their cardholders
  - Queues transactions for matching process

**5. Transaction Matching (4:00 AM)** - *Performed by: Issuing Bank & Acquiring Bank (independently)*
- **Issuing Bank performs:**
  - Matches clearing record against original authorization
  - Validates authorization code, transaction amount, merchant ID
  - Checks transaction timestamps for validity
  - Identifies discrepancies:
    - Amount mismatches (e.g., tip added after authorization)
    - Missing authorizations (force captures)
    - Duplicate transactions
  - Flags exceptions for reconciliation
- **Acquiring Bank performs:**
  - Matches clearing records against authorizations sent
  - Validates merchant settlement data
  - Identifies exceptions and mismatches
  - Queues discrepancies for review and resolution

**6. Reconciliation (6:00 AM)** - *Performed by: Card Network (coordinating between banks)*
- **Issuing Bank:**
  - Submits exception reports to Card Network
  - Provides details on mismatched transactions
- **Acquiring Bank:**
  - Submits exception reports to Card Network
  - Flags problematic merchant transactions
- **Card Network:**
  - Analyzes exception reports from both sides
  - Resolves mismatches using transaction logs
  - Updates transaction records with corrections
  - Sends reconciliation confirmations to both banks
- **Both Banks:**
  - Update local records based on network confirmations
  - Mark transactions as validated and ready for settlement

**7. Interchange/Fee Calculation (8:00 AM)** - *Performed by: Card Network*
- **Card Network (Visa/Mastercard) calculates:**
  - **Interchange fees** (issuer's revenue from acquirer)
    - Applies rate tables based on: card type (debit/credit), merchant category code (MCC), transaction type
    - Example: 2.5% of $100 = $2.50 → Issuing Bank receives from Acquiring Bank
  - **Assessment fees** (network's revenue)
    - Example: 0.13% of $100 = $0.13 → Card Network receives
  - **Processing fees** (acquirer's fee to merchant)
    - Example: 0.3% of $100 = $0.30 → Acquiring Bank receives from Merchant
  - Calculates net amount per transaction after all fees
- **Card Network sends:**
  - Fee breakdown notification to Acquiring Bank
  - Fee breakdown notification to Issuing Bank
- **Issuing Bank:**
  - Records expected fee revenues
  - Updates transaction profitability tracking

**8. Netting (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM)** - *Performed by: Card Network ONLY*
- **Card Network (Visa/Mastercard) performs:**
  - Aggregates ALL transactions across ALL participating banks globally
  - Sums all debits and credits for each bank
  - Calculates bilateral net positions between bank pairs
  - Generates multilateral net positions (who owes whom overall)
  - **Example Netting Across Network:**
    - **Issuing Bank A** (customers bought from Bank B's merchants): Owes $1M
    - **Issuing Bank B** (customers bought from Bank A's merchants): Owes $800K
    - **Net result:** Bank A owes Bank B $200K (instead of two separate $1M and $800K transfers)
  - Creates settlement instructions for each bank
  - Stores settlement instructions in Settlement Database
- **Card Network sends:**
  - Net position notification to Issuing Bank: "You owe $2M"
  - Net position notification to Acquiring Bank: "You will receive $1.8M"
- **Settlement Database:**
  - Stores all settlement instructions
  - Prepares for Day 2 fund transfers
- **Why ONLY the Network can do this:**
  - Card Network is the only entity seeing ALL transactions across ALL banks
  - Individual banks only see their own transactions
  - Prevents banks from calculating separately (would cause inconsistencies)
  - Reduces settlement volume by 90%+ through netting
- **Clearing Phase Complete** - All parties have their net positions; ready for actual fund movement

  - Receives and validates settlement instruction from Network
  - Prepares to credit Acquiring Bank's settlement account

**10. Interbank Settlement - Actual Fund Movement (8:00 AM - 10:00 AM)** - *Performed by: Settlement Banks & Card Network*
- **Issuer's Settlement Bank:**
  - Verifies Issuing Bank has sufficient funds in settlement account
  - Debits Issuing Bank's settlement account: -$2M
  - Initiates wire transfer to Card Network: $2M
- **Card Network:**
  - Receives wire transfer from Issuer's Settlement Bank: +$2M
  - Processes and verifies funds received
  - Deducts network assessment fees: -$200K (retained by network)
  - Initiates wire transfer to Acquirer's Settlement Bank: $1.8M
- **Acquirer's Settlement Bank:**
  - Receives wire transfer from Card Network: +$1.8M
  - Credits Acquiring Bank's settlement account: +$1.8M
  - Confirms receipt to Card Network
- **Result:** Funds have moved between banks; settlement is **final and irrevocable**

**11. Settlement Confirmation (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM)** - *Performed by: Card Network & Banks*
- **Card Network sends:**
  - Settlement confirmation to Issuing Bank: "Your account debited $2M - settlement complete"
  - Settlement confirmation to Acquiring Bank: "Your account credited $1.8M - settlement complete"
- **Issuing Bank:**
  - Verifies settlement completion against expected net position
  - Posts charges to cardholder accounts (previously authorized amounts now settled)
  - Updates cardholder statements
  - Reconciles internal accounting
- **Acquiring Bank:**
  - Verifies settlement completion against expected net position
  - Confirms funds available for merchant payouts
  - Prepares merchant funding queue
  - Updates internal accounting

**12. Merchant Funding (12:00 PM - 2:00 PM)** - *Performed by: Acquiring Bank*
- **Acquiring Bank:**
  - Processes all pending merchant settlements from the batch
  - Calculates each merchant's net payout:
    - **Example for $100 transaction:**
      - Gross sales: $100.00
      - Less interchange (to issuer): -$2.50
      - Less network assessment: -$0.13
      - Less acquirer processing fee: -$0.30
      - **Net to merchant: $97.07**
  - Deducts all applicable fees
  - Initiates ACH transfer or wire to merchant's business bank account
  - Sends settlement notification to merchant with transaction details
- **Merchant:**
  - Receives ACH/wire transfer: $97.07 in business bank account
  - Receives settlement report showing breakdown of fees
  - Updates accounting and bookkeeping records
  - **Can now access and use the funds**
- **Transaction Lifecycle Complete ✅** - Money has moved from cardholder → issuing bank → network → acquiring bank → merchant
