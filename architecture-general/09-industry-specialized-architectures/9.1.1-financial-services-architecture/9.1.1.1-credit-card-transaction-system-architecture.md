# 9.1.1.1 Credit Card Transaction System Architecture

## Overview

Credit Card Transaction System Architecture defines the end-to-end flow of payment card transactions, from the moment a cardholder initiates a payment to the final settlement between financial institutions. This architecture must handle millions of transactions per day with sub-second response times while maintaining the highest levels of security and compliance.
