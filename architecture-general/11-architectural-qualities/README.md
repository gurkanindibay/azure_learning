# 11. Architectural Qualities (Non-Functional)

This section covers non-functional requirements that apply across all architecture types.

## Quality Attributes

- **Scalability** - Ability to handle increased load
- **Security** - Protection against threats and vulnerabilities
- **Reliability & Resilience** - Consistent operation and recovery from failures
- **Performance** - Response time and throughput
- **Maintainability** - Ease of modification and updates
- **Extensibility** - Ability to add new features
- **Portability** - Ability to run in different environments
- **Compliance & Regulatory** - Meeting legal and industry requirements
- **Sustainability (Green IT)** - Environmental impact considerations

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

These qualities influence decisions across all architecture layers:
- Conceptual → How capabilities are structured
- Logical → How components are designed
- Physical → How technologies are selected
- Runtime → How systems are operated
