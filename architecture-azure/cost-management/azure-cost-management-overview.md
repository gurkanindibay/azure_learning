## Overview

**Azure Cost Management and Billing** is a suite of tools that helps you monitor, allocate, and optimize your Azure spending. It provides insights into where your money is being spent, enables you to set budgets and alerts, and helps identify optimization opportunities.

### Key Capabilities

- **Cost Analysis**: Visualize and analyze costs across different dimensions
- **Budgets**: Set spending thresholds and receive alerts
- **Cost Allocation**: Distribute costs using tags and resource organization
- **Recommendations**: Get AI-powered cost optimization suggestions
- **Exports**: Schedule automatic cost data exports
- **Forecasting**: Predict future costs based on historical trends

### Why Cost Management Matters

- 💰 **Visibility**: Understand where money is being spent
- 🎯 **Accountability**: Allocate costs to projects, teams, or departments
- 📊 **Optimization**: Identify and eliminate waste
- ⚠️ **Prevention**: Set guardrails to prevent cost overruns
- 📈 **Planning**: Forecast future spending for budgeting

## Core Components

### Cost Analysis

**Cost Analysis** provides interactive views of your Azure spending with filtering, grouping, and visualization capabilities.

**Key Features**:
- View costs by subscription, resource group, service, location, or tags
- Time-based analysis (daily, monthly, accumulated)
- Custom date ranges
- Forecast future costs
- Compare current vs previous periods

**Common Views**:
```
Costs by Resource Group
Costs by Service (e.g., VMs, Storage, Networking)
Costs by Location
Costs by Resource Tags (e.g., Project, Environment, Department)
```

### Budgets

**Azure Budgets** allow you to set spending thresholds and receive alerts when costs approach or exceed defined limits.

**Characteristics**:
- Set monthly, quarterly, or annual budgets
- Define multiple alert thresholds (e.g., 50%, 80%, 100%)
- Alert via email or action groups
- Budget resets automatically per period
- Can be scoped to subscriptions, resource groups, or management groups

**Budget Types**:
- **Cost budgets**: Track actual spending
- **Usage budgets**: Track resource consumption (e.g., compute hours)

**Alert Thresholds**:
```
Example Budget: $10,000/month

Alert at 50%:  $5,000  → Warning notification
Alert at 80%:  $8,000  → Critical notification
Alert at 100%: $10,000 → Budget exceeded notification
Alert at 120%: $12,000 → Overspend notification
```

### Resource Tags

**Resource Tags** are key-value pairs that you attach to Azure resources to organize and categorize them for cost allocation and management.

**Format**: `Key: Value`

**Examples**:
```
Project: ProjectA
Environment: Production
Department: Engineering
CostCenter: CC-1234
Owner: john.doe@company.com
```

**Key Characteristics**:
- Maximum 50 tags per resource/resource group/subscription
- Tag names are **case-insensitive** for operations
- Tag values are **case-sensitive**
- Supports special characters
- Can be applied via Portal, CLI, PowerShell, ARM templates

**Use Cases**:
- Cost allocation by project/department
- Resource organization and filtering
- Automation and policy enforcement
- Lifecycle management
- Compliance tracking

### Cost Alerts

**Cost Alerts** notify you when spending reaches defined thresholds or anomalies are detected.

**Alert Types**:
1. **Budget Alerts**: Triggered when budget thresholds are reached
2. **Credit Alerts**: For EA customers with monetary commitments
3. **Department Spending Quota Alerts**: For EA departments
4. **Anomaly Alerts**: AI-detected unusual spending patterns

**Notification Methods**:
- Email notifications
- Action Groups (webhook, logic apps, automation runbooks)
- Azure Monitor integration

### Advisor Recommendations

**Azure Advisor** provides personalized recommendations to optimize costs, including:

- Right-size or shutdown underutilized VMs
- Delete unattached disks
- Purchase reserved instances
- Use Azure Hybrid Benefit
- Optimize storage tiers
- Eliminate idle resources

## Resource Tags in Detail

### Why Resource Tags for Cost Management?

**Problem**: You have resources across 12 subscriptions and 3 projects. How do you track costs per project?

**Solution**: Resource Tags enable **logical grouping** independent of resource location or subscription.

```
Subscription 1:
  ├─ VM1 (Tag: Project=ProjectA)
  ├─ VM2 (Tag: Project=ProjectB)
  └─ Storage1 (Tag: Project=ProjectA)

Subscription 2:
  ├─ VM3 (Tag: Project=ProjectA)
  ├─ Database1 (Tag: Project=ProjectC)
  └─ Storage2 (Tag: Project=ProjectB)

Cost Analysis → Group by "Project" tag
  → View costs for ProjectA across all subscriptions
```

### Tag Inheritance

**Important**: Tags do **NOT** inherit automatically from resource groups or subscriptions.

```
Subscription: Project=ProjectA
  └─ Resource Group: Project=ProjectA
      └─ VM1: (no tag)  ❌ Does NOT inherit ProjectA tag

Solution: Apply tags at resource level or use Azure Policy to enforce
```

### Tagging Best Practices

#### 1. Define Tag Schema

Create a consistent tagging strategy across your organization:

```
Required Tags:
- Project: (ProjectA, ProjectB, ProjectC)
- Environment: (Production, Staging, Development)
- CostCenter: (CC-1234, CC-5678)
- Owner: (email address)

Optional Tags:
- Department: (Engineering, Sales, Marketing)
- Application: (WebApp, API, Database)
- Criticality: (High, Medium, Low)
```

#### 2. Enforce with Azure Policy

Use Azure Policy to require tags at resource creation:

```json
{
  "policyRule": {
    "if": {
      "field": "tags['Project']",
      "exists": "false"
    },
    "then": {
      "effect": "deny"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Automate Tag Application

Use scripts to tag existing resources:

```bash
# Tag all VMs in a resource group
az vm list --resource-group MyRG --query "[].id" -o tsv | \
  xargs -I {} az resource tag --ids {} --tags Project=ProjectA
```

### Tag Limitations

| Aspect | Limitation |
|--------|------------|
| **Maximum tags** | 50 per resource/RG/subscription |
| **Tag name length** | 512 characters |
| **Tag value length** | 256 characters |
| **Inheritance** | No automatic inheritance |
| **Classic resources** | Tags not supported |
| **Tag name case** | Case-insensitive |
| **Tag value case** | Case-sensitive |

### Using Tags for Cost Allocation

#### Step 1: Apply Tags to Resources

```bash
# Tag resources with project identifier
az resource tag --ids /subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/RG1/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/VM1 \
  --tags Project=ProjectA Environment=Production
```

#### Step 2: View Costs by Tag in Cost Analysis

1. Open Azure Cost Management
2. Select "Cost Analysis"
3. Add filter: `Tag = Project`
4. Group by: `Tag:Project`
5. Result: See costs broken down by ProjectA, ProjectB, ProjectC

#### Step 3: Create Budgets per Project

1. Create budget scoped to subscription
2. Filter budget by tag: `Project = ProjectA`
3. Set threshold alerts (50%, 80%, 100%)
4. Result: Budget tracks only ProjectA resources

## Budgets in Detail

### Why Budgets for Cost Management?

**Problem**: Need to control spending and get alerted before cost overruns occur.

**Solution**: Budgets provide proactive monitoring with automatic alerts.

### Budget Configuration

#### Basic Setup

```
Scope: Subscription or Resource Group
Filter: (Optional) Resource tags, services, locations
Amount: $10,000
Time Period: Monthly
Start Date: January 1, 2025
Alerts:
  - 50% ($5,000) → email@company.com
  - 80% ($8,000) → email@company.com
  - 100% ($10,000) → email@company.com + action group
```

#### Tag-Filtered Budget

```
Budget: ProjectA Monthly Budget
Scope: Subscription
Filter: Tag "Project" equals "ProjectA"
Amount: $5,000/month
Alerts: 50%, 80%, 100%
```

**Result**: Budget tracks only resources tagged with `Project=ProjectA`, regardless of which subscription or resource group they're in.

### Budget Alert Flow

```
Resource spending increases
↓
Azure tracks accumulated costs
↓
Cost reaches 50% of budget ($5,000)
↓
Alert sent to email@company.com
↓
Cost reaches 80% of budget ($8,000)
↓
Critical alert sent + notification
↓
Cost reaches 100% of budget ($10,000)
↓
Budget exceeded alert + action group triggered
```

### Budget Scopes

| Scope | Use Case | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Management Group** | Organization-wide budget | All subscriptions |
| **Subscription** | Subscription-level budget | Per subscription limit |
| **Resource Group** | Project/application budget | Single project resources |
| **Filtered** | Cross-subscription tag-based | All ProjectA resources |

### Budget Automation

Budgets can trigger automated actions via **Action Groups**:

```
Budget threshold reached (100%)
↓
Action Group triggered
↓
Choices:
  - Send webhook to Logic App
  - Trigger Azure Function
  - Run Automation Runbook
  - Send notification to Teams/Slack
  
Action Examples:
  - Shut down non-production VMs
  - Send approval request
  - Scale down resources
  - Block new resource creation
```

### Budget Best Practices

✅ **Set realistic thresholds** - Base on historical data and growth projections  
✅ **Use multiple alert levels** - 50%, 80%, 100% for graduated response  
✅ **Filter by tags** - Track costs for logical groupings (projects, departments)  
✅ **Review regularly** - Adjust budgets based on actual needs  
✅ **Automate responses** - Use action groups for critical thresholds  
✅ **Create hierarchical budgets** - Top-level org budget + per-project budgets  

## Scopes and Access

### Cost Management Scopes

Cost Management operates at multiple scope levels:

```
Management Group (Organization)
  └─ Subscription 1
      ├─ Resource Group A
      │   └─ Resources
      └─ Resource Group B
          └─ Resources
  └─ Subscription 2
      └─ Resource Group C
          └─ Resources
```

**Scope Capabilities**:
- **Management Group**: View costs across all subscriptions
- **Subscription**: View costs for entire subscription
- **Resource Group**: View costs for specific resource group
- **Tag-filtered**: View costs for resources with specific tags (cross-scope)

### Access Control (RBAC)

Cost Management uses Azure RBAC for access control:

| Role | Permissions | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Cost Management Reader** | View costs and configuration | Read-only access |
| **Cost Management Contributor** | View costs, create budgets and exports | Cost management team |
| **Contributor** | Full resource + cost management | Project administrators |
| **Owner** | Full control | Subscription owners |

**Custom Role Example** (Cost Analyst):
```json
{
  "Name": "Cost Analyst",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Actions": [
    "Microsoft.CostManagement/*/read",
    "Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/*",
    "Microsoft.CostManagement/budgets/read"
  ],
  "NotActions": [],
  "AssignableScopes": ["/subscriptions/{subscription-id}"]
}
```

## Management Groups vs Resource Tags

### When to Use Each

| Scenario | Best Approach | Reason |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Cost monitoring across subscriptions** | Resource Tags | Tags cross subscription boundaries |
| **Policy enforcement across subscriptions** | Management Groups | Hierarchical policy inheritance |
| **Per-project cost tracking** | Resource Tags | Flexible, granular labeling |
| **Governance and compliance** | Management Groups | Centralized control |
| **Budget per project across subscriptions** | Tags + Budgets | Logical grouping independent of hierarchy |

### Why Not Management Groups for Per-Project Costs?

**Management Groups** are designed for:
- Organizational hierarchy
- Policy enforcement across subscriptions
- Centralized governance
- Access control at scale

**Limitations for Cost Monitoring**:
- ❌ Don't provide granular project-level filtering
- ❌ Require restructuring subscription hierarchy
- ❌ Not designed for cross-cutting concerns (projects span subscriptions)
- ❌ More administrative overhead to maintain
- ❌ Don't support tag-based cost allocation

**Example**:
```
❌ Management Group Approach (Complex):
Management Group: All Subscriptions
  └─ Sub1 (ProjectA + ProjectB resources mixed)
  └─ Sub2 (ProjectA + ProjectC resources mixed)
  └─ Sub3 (ProjectB + ProjectC resources mixed)

Problem: Can't separate costs by project without moving resources

✅ Resource Tag Approach (Simple):
All Subscriptions
  └─ All Resources tagged with Project=ProjectA, ProjectB, or ProjectC
  
Cost Analysis → Filter by Tag → See per-project costs
Budgets → Filter by Tag → Track per-project budgets
```

## Cost Allocation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Tag-Based Allocation (Recommended)

**Best For**: Multiple projects across subscriptions

**Implementation**:
1. Define tag schema: `Project`, `Environment`, `CostCenter`
2. Apply tags to all resources
3. Create filtered budgets per project
4. Use Cost Analysis grouped by tags

**Pros**:
- ✅ Flexible and granular
- ✅ Cross-subscription support
- ✅ Minimal administrative effort
- ✅ Easy to implement

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Requires tag discipline
- ⚠️ No automatic inheritance

### Strategy 2: Resource Group Separation

**Best For**: Isolated projects with dedicated resource groups

**Implementation**:
1. Create resource group per project: `RG-ProjectA`, `RG-ProjectB`
2. Deploy all project resources to respective RG
3. Create budgets scoped to resource groups
4. View costs per resource group

**Pros**:
- ✅ Clear separation
- ✅ Simple to understand
- ✅ Built-in scope

**Cons**:
- ❌ Limited to single subscription (typically)
- ❌ Rigid structure
- ❌ Harder to share resources

### Strategy 3: Subscription Separation

**Best For**: Strict isolation requirements (compliance, billing)

**Implementation**:
1. Create subscription per project
2. Deploy all resources to respective subscription
3. Separate billing
4. Use Management Groups for governance

**Pros**:
- ✅ Complete isolation
- ✅ Separate billing
- ✅ Clear cost boundaries

**Cons**:
- ❌ High administrative overhead
- ❌ Expensive (multiple subscriptions)
- ❌ Resource sharing complexity
- ❌ Limited scalability

### Strategy 4: Hybrid Approach

**Best For**: Complex organizations with multiple requirements

**Implementation**:
1. Use subscriptions for major boundaries (Production, Non-Production)
2. Use resource groups for applications/systems
3. Use tags for cross-cutting concerns (projects, cost centers)
4. Use Management Groups for governance

**Example**:
```
Management Group: Organization
  └─ Subscription: Production
      ├─ RG: App1 (Tags: Project=ProjectA, Env=Prod)
      └─ RG: App2 (Tags: Project=ProjectB, Env=Prod)
  └─ Subscription: Non-Production
      ├─ RG: App1-Dev (Tags: Project=ProjectA, Env=Dev)
      └─ RG: App2-Test (Tags: Project=ProjectB, Env=Test)

Cost Views:
- By Subscription → Production vs Non-Production costs
- By Resource Group → Per-application costs
- By Tag (Project) → ProjectA vs ProjectB costs (cross-subscription)
```

## Best Practices

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Inconsistent tagging** - Leads to inaccurate cost allocation  
❌ **Setting unrealistic budgets** - Too low causes alert fatigue  
❌ **Ignoring advisor recommendations** - Misses optimization opportunities  
❌ **No budget alerts** - No warning before cost overruns  
❌ **Manual processes** - Doesn't scale, error-prone  
❌ **Infrequent reviews** - Costs spiral before detection  

## Azure Cost Optimization Strategies

Azure provides several cost optimization mechanisms for compute resources. Understanding when to use each strategy is crucial for minimizing costs while meeting security, compliance, and availability requirements.

### Azure Reservations (Reserved Instances)

**Azure Reservations** allow you to commit to 1-year or 3-year terms for virtual machines and other Azure services in exchange for significant cost savings.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Discount**: Up to 72% compared to pay-as-you-go pricing
- **Commitment**: 1-year or 3-year term
- **Payment Options**: Upfront, monthly, or no upfront (3-year only)
- **Flexibility**: Can exchange or cancel with restrictions
- **Scope**: Shared across subscription or management group

**When to Use**:
✅ Long-running production workloads  
✅ Predictable and consistent resource usage  
✅ Dedicated VMs with stable requirements  
✅ Workloads that must meet strict compliance and availability requirements  
✅ Known capacity needs for extended periods  

**When NOT to Use**:
❌ Variable or unpredictable workloads  
❌ Short-term projects or POCs  
❌ Workloads that may be scaled down or decommissioned  
❌ When testing new services with uncertain requirements  

**Example Scenario**:
> **App1 Migration**: A production application running on Ubuntu VMs is being migrated to Azure. The workload is long-running and must meet strict security and compliance requirements. Since the compute needs are predictable and the VMs will run continuously, **Azure Reservations** provide up to 72% cost savings compared to pay-as-you-go pricing.

**Supported Services**:
- Virtual Machines
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure Synapse Analytics
- Azure App Service
- Azure Storage (reserved capacity)

**Cost Savings Calculation**:
```
Pay-as-you-go: $730/month (D4s v3 VM)
1-year reservation: $450/month → 38% savings
3-year reservation: $300/month → 59% savings

Annual savings (3-year): ($730 - $300) × 12 = $5,160 per VM
```

---

### Azure Hybrid Benefit

**Azure Hybrid Benefit** allows you to use existing on-premises Windows Server and SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance on Azure, reducing compute costs.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Discount**: Up to 40% on Windows VMs, up to 55% on SQL Server
- **Requirements**: Active Software Assurance or subscription licenses
- **License Coverage**: 1 Windows Server license = up to 2 VMs (8 cores each)
- **No Commitment**: Can enable/disable at any time
- **Flexibility**: Works with Reserved Instances for additional savings

**When to Use**:
✅ Existing Windows Server licenses with Software Assurance  
✅ Existing SQL Server Enterprise or Standard licenses  
✅ Migrating on-premises Windows workloads to Azure  
✅ Maximizing value from existing license investments  

**When NOT to Use**:
❌ Linux-based workloads (Ubuntu, Red Hat, SUSE)  
❌ No existing Windows Server or SQL Server licenses  
❌ No active Software Assurance  
❌ Short-term testing (may not justify license allocation)  

**Example Scenario**:
> **Linux Migration**: An application hosted on Ubuntu is being migrated to Azure. Since **Azure Hybrid Benefit only applies to Windows Server and SQL Server** workloads with active Software Assurance, it cannot be used for Linux-based applications. Alternative cost optimization strategies like Azure Reservations should be considered instead.

**Supported Products**:
- Windows Server Datacenter
- Windows Server Standard
- SQL Server Enterprise
- SQL Server Standard
- RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) - separate RHEL benefit
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) - separate SUSE benefit

**Cost Savings Calculation**:
```
Windows VM Pay-as-you-go: $500/month
Windows VM with Hybrid Benefit: $300/month → 40% savings
Windows VM with Hybrid Benefit + 3-year RI: $180/month → 64% savings

Combined savings: $500 - $180 = $320/month = $3,840/year per VM
```

---

### Azure Spot Virtual Machines

**Azure Spot VMs** offer deep discounts (up to 90% off) for workloads that can tolerate interruptions, utilizing Azure's unused compute capacity.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Discount**: Up to 90% compared to pay-as-you-go pricing
- **Availability**: Not guaranteed - can be evicted with 30-second notice
- **Eviction Policy**: Capacity-based or price-based eviction
- **No SLA**: No availability guarantee
- **Pricing**: Variable based on demand

**When to Use**:
✅ Batch processing jobs  
✅ Dev/test environments  
✅ Stateless applications  
✅ Non-critical background workloads  
✅ Fault-tolerant distributed systems  
✅ High-performance computing (HPC) with checkpointing  
✅ Rendering and media processing  

**When NOT to Use**:
❌ Production workloads requiring high availability  
❌ Applications with strict SLA requirements  
❌ Workloads that must meet compliance requirements  
❌ Stateful applications without checkpoint/restart capability  
❌ Real-time processing systems  
❌ Long-running jobs that can't be interrupted  

**Example Scenario**:
> **Production App with Compliance**: App1 is being migrated as a long-running production workload that must meet strict security and compliance requirements. Since **Spot VMs are designed for interruption-tolerant, non-production workloads** and offer no availability guarantees, they are **not appropriate** for this scenario. The application requires consistent availability that Spot VMs cannot provide.

**Eviction Policies**:
1. **Capacity**: Evicted when Azure needs capacity back
2. **Price**: Evicted when Spot price exceeds your max price

**Best Practices**:
- Implement graceful shutdown handlers
- Use eviction notifications (30 seconds)
- Distribute workload across multiple Spot VMs
- Combine Spot with regular VMs for hybrid approach
- Enable auto-scaling to replace evicted instances

**Cost Savings Calculation**:
```
Pay-as-you-go: $730/month (D4s v3 VM)
Spot VM (average discount): $150/month → 79% savings

Monthly savings: $730 - $150 = $580 per VM

Note: Pricing varies based on region and demand
```

### Decision Framework: Choosing the Right Strategy

```
Start: Need to minimize compute costs?
  │
  ├─ Is this a production workload with compliance/SLA requirements?
  │   │
  │   ├─ Yes → Consider Azure Reservations
  │   │   │
  │   │   └─ Are you migrating Windows/SQL workloads with existing licenses?
  │   │       │
  │   │       ├─ Yes → Use Hybrid Benefit + Reservations (stackable!)
  │   │       └─ No → Use Reservations only
  │   │
  │   └─ No → Is the workload interruption-tolerant?
  │       │
  │       ├─ Yes → Consider Spot VMs
  │       └─ No → Consider pay-as-you-go or Reservations
  │
  └─ Additional Optimization
      ├─ Right-size VMs using Azure Advisor
      ├─ Auto-scale for variable workloads
      ├─ Auto-shutdown for dev/test environments
      └─ Use Azure Cost Management for ongoing monitoring
```

---

### Combining Strategies for Maximum Savings

Multiple cost optimization strategies can be combined for maximum savings:

**Stack 1: Hybrid Benefit + Reservations**
```
Windows VM baseline: $500/month
Apply Hybrid Benefit: $300/month (40% off)
Apply 3-year RI: $180/month (additional 40% off)

Total savings: 64% off pay-as-you-go pricing
Combined discount: $500 - $180 = $320/month = $3,840/year
```

**Stack 2: Reservations + Auto-scaling**
```
Reserve baseline capacity: 10 VMs with RI (predictable load)
Use pay-as-you-go for burst: 0-20 VMs with auto-scale (variable load)

Result: Guaranteed savings on baseline + flexibility for spikes
```

**Stack 3: Spot VMs + Regular VMs (Hybrid Approach)**
```
Critical components: Regular VMs (guaranteed availability)
Background processing: Spot VMs (deep discounts)
Auto-scale replacement: Regular VMs replace evicted Spot instances

Result: Cost savings on non-critical components + reliability where needed
```

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: Per-Project Cost Monitoring Across Subscriptions

**Scenario**:
You have 12 Azure subscriptions and three projects. Each project uses resources across multiple subscriptions.

You need to use Microsoft Cost Management to monitor costs on a per-project basis. The solution must minimize administrative effort.

**Question**: Which two components should you include in the solution?

**Options**:
- A. Budgets
- B. Resource tags
- C. Custom role-based access control (RBAC) roles
- D. Management groups
- E. Azure Boards

**Correct Answer**: A and B (Budgets and Resource Tags)

---

#### Explanation

**Why Budgets? ✅**

Azure Budgets serve as a valuable tool for monitoring costs in a project. With Azure Budgets, you can:

1. **Set Project-Specific Spending Thresholds**: Define budgets for each project (ProjectA, ProjectB, ProjectC)

2. **Filter by Tags**: Create budgets that filter resources by project tags, regardless of which subscription they're in

3. **Proactive Cost Management**: Receive alerts when spending approaches or exceeds defined limits

4. **Minimal Administrative Effort**: Once configured, budgets automatically track costs and send alerts

**Example**:
```
Budget: ProjectA Monthly Budget
Scope: Subscription (or multiple subscriptions)
Filter: Tag "Project" equals "ProjectA"
Amount: $10,000/month
Alerts:
  - 50% → Warning
  - 80% → Critical
  - 100% → Budget exceeded
  
Result: Tracks all ProjectA resources across all 12 subscriptions
```

**Key Benefits**:
- 🎯 Proactive monitoring without manual tracking
- 📧 Automatic alerts when thresholds are reached
- 🔄 Resets automatically per period
- 🏷️ Works with tag filters for cross-subscription projects

---

**Why Resource Tags? ✅**

Azure resource tags are key-value pairs that help label resources, enabling categorization based on attributes like projects.

**How Tags Enable Per-Project Monitoring**:

1. **Logical Grouping**: Tag all resources with project identifier, regardless of subscription or resource group

```
Subscription 1:
  ├─ VM1 (Tag: Project=ProjectA)
  ├─ VM2 (Tag: Project=ProjectB)
  └─ Storage1 (Tag: Project=ProjectA)

Subscription 2:
  ├─ VM3 (Tag: Project=ProjectA)
  ├─ Database1 (Tag: Project=ProjectC)
  └─ Storage2 (Tag: Project=ProjectB)

Subscription 3-12: (similar distribution)
```

2. **Cost Allocation**: View costs filtered and grouped by tags in Cost Analysis

```
Cost Analysis → Filter by Tag "Project" → Group by "Project"

Result:
ProjectA: $15,000 (resources across Sub 1, 2, 5, 7)
ProjectB: $12,000 (resources across Sub 1, 3, 4, 8)
ProjectC: $8,000 (resources across Sub 2, 6, 9, 12)
```

3. **Budget Integration**: Combine tags with budgets to track per-project spending

```
Budget A: Filter by Project=ProjectA → $20,000/month
Budget B: Filter by Project=ProjectB → $15,000/month
Budget C: Filter by Project=ProjectC → $10,000/month
```

4. **Minimal Administrative Effort**: Once tagged, resources automatically appear in filtered views

**Tag Characteristics**:
- ✅ Maximum 50 tags per resource
- ✅ Tag names are case-insensitive for operations
- ✅ Tag values are case-sensitive
- ✅ Can be applied to resources, resource groups, subscriptions
- ✅ Enable automation and policy enforcement

**Tag Schema Example**:
```
Project: ProjectA | ProjectB | ProjectC
Environment: Production | Staging | Development
CostCenter: CC-1001 | CC-1002 | CC-1003
Owner: project.owner@company.com
```

#### Why Other Options Are Incorrect

**Custom RBAC Roles ❌**

**Why Incorrect**:

While Azure RBAC excels in managing access to Azure resources by defining who can perform specific actions and where, it primarily focuses on **authorization** rather than specialized cost monitoring.

**RBAC Purpose**:
- Control who can access resources
- Define what actions users can perform
- Manage permissions at various scopes

**For Cost Management**:
- Built-in roles already exist (Cost Management Reader, Contributor)
- Custom roles don't provide additional cost monitoring capabilities
- RBAC is about access control, not cost tracking

**Example**:
```
Custom Role: "Project Manager"
Permissions:
  - Microsoft.CostManagement/*/read
  - Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read

Result: User can VIEW costs, but role doesn't enable per-project tracking
        Still need tags to filter costs by project
```

**Alternative**:
Instead of custom roles, use built-in "Cost Management Contributor" role for project managers to access cost data, combined with tags for filtering.

**Conclusion**: RBAC roles control access to cost data but don't enable cost allocation or per-project monitoring. Tags + Budgets provide the actual cost tracking mechanism.

---

**Management Groups ❌**

**Why Incorrect**:

Management Groups in Azure offer a structured approach to organize and govern subscriptions, primarily focusing on:
- Governance
- Policy enforcement  
- Compliance standards

**Management Group Purpose**:
```
Management Group Hierarchy:
Root Management Group
  └─ Production MG
      ├─ Subscription 1
      └─ Subscription 2
  └─ Non-Production MG
      ├─ Subscription 3
      └─ Subscription 4

Use Cases:
✅ Apply policies across subscriptions
✅ Enforce compliance standards
✅ Centralized governance
✅ RBAC inheritance
```

**Limitations for Per-Project Cost Monitoring**:

1. **Not Designed for Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - Projects span multiple subscriptions
   - Management Groups organize subscriptions hierarchically
   - Can't group ProjectA resources across different subscriptions in hierarchy

2. **Lack Granular Cost Filtering**
   ```
   ❌ Management Group Approach:
   Can view costs at MG level (all subscriptions combined)
   Can't filter costs by project within subscriptions
   
   ✅ Tag Approach:
   Filter costs by Project=ProjectA across all subscriptions
   ```

3. **Higher Administrative Effort**
   - Would require restructuring subscription hierarchy
   - Moving subscriptions between management groups
   - Doesn't solve cross-subscription project tracking

4. **Missing Real-Time Alerts**
   - Management Groups don't have built-in alerting
   - No threshold-based notifications
   - Manual monitoring required

**Example Scenario**:
```
Reality: ProjectA uses resources in Subscriptions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12

Management Group Approach:
Would need to move these subscriptions under "ProjectA MG"
But ProjectB also uses Subscription 1 → Conflict!
Can't place subscription in multiple management groups

Tag Approach:
Tag ProjectA resources in any subscription with Project=ProjectA
View costs for all ProjectA resources regardless of subscription
```

**Conclusion**: Management Groups excel at governance and policy enforcement across subscriptions but may not be the optimal solution for specific, alert-driven, cross-subscription cost monitoring needs. They lack the granular, real-time cost monitoring capabilities essential for detailed project-level cost management.

**Azure Boards ❌**

**Why Incorrect**:

Azure Boards is a web-based service primarily focused on **agile project management**, work tracking, and collaborative discussions throughout the development process.

**Azure Boards Purpose**:
- Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)
- Work item management (user stories, tasks, bugs)
- Sprint planning
- Backlog management
- Team collaboration

**Not a Cost Management Tool**:
- ❌ No financial monitoring capabilities
- ❌ No cost analysis features
- ❌ No budget tracking
- ❌ No cost alerts
- ❌ No integration with Azure Cost Management

**What Azure Boards Does**:
```
Sprint Planning:
- User Story: Implement feature X
- Task: Design database schema
- Bug: Fix login issue

Cost Management Needs:
- How much is this sprint costing?
- What's our monthly Azure spend?
- Alert when budget threshold reached?

Azure Boards: ❌ Cannot answer these questions
Cost Management: ✅ Designed for these questions
```

---

#### Why Other Options Are Incorrect

**Azure Advisor ❌**

**Why Incorrect**:

Azure Advisor is a **post-deployment optimization tool** that provides recommendations for already deployed Azure resources. It cannot be used for pre-migration cost estimation.

**Azure Advisor Purpose**:
```
Provides recommendations for:
✅ Cost optimization (after deployment)
✅ Performance improvements
✅ High availability
✅ Security enhancements
✅ Operational excellence

Example Recommendations:
- "Right-size or shutdown underutilized VMs"
- "Use reserved instances to save costs"
- "Enable backup for critical resources"
- "Apply security patches to VMs"
```

**Limitations for Migration Planning**:
- ❌ Requires resources to already be deployed in Azure
- ❌ No pre-migration cost estimation capabilities
- ❌ Cannot analyze on-premises infrastructure
- ❌ Does not compare on-premises vs Azure costs
- ❌ Not designed for migration planning

**Timeline**:
```
Pre-Migration (Planning Phase):
  → Azure TCO Calculator ✅
  → Azure Advisor ❌ (nothing deployed yet)

Post-Deployment (Optimization Phase):
  → Azure TCO Calculator ❌ (migration complete)
  → Azure Advisor ✅ (optimize existing resources)
```

**Conclusion**: Azure Advisor is valuable for optimizing costs **after** migration, not for estimating costs **before** migration.

---

**The Azure Cost Management Power BI App ❌**

**Why Incorrect**:

The **Azure Cost Management Power BI App** is used for analyzing and visualizing cost and usage data of **already deployed Azure resources**. It is not intended for pre-migration forecasting or cost estimation.

**Power BI App Purpose**:
```
Capabilities:
✅ Visualize actual Azure spending
✅ Analyze cost trends over time
✅ Create custom cost reports and dashboards
✅ Track departmental chargebacks
✅ Monitor budget vs actual spending
✅ Identify cost anomalies

Example Dashboards:
- Monthly cost trends by service
- Department-wise cost allocation
- Cost comparison: This month vs last month
- Top 10 most expensive resources
```

**Requirements**:
- Requires active Azure subscription
- Requires existing Azure resources with cost data
- Requires Cost Management data to be available
- Designed for **historical and current** cost analysis

**Limitations for Migration Planning**:
- ❌ Cannot estimate costs for resources not yet deployed
- ❌ No on-premises infrastructure comparison
- ❌ Requires actual Azure usage data
- ❌ Not designed for pre-migration analysis
- ❌ Does not support "what-if" scenarios for migration

**Use Case Timeline**:
```
Pre-Migration:
  → Power BI App ❌ (no Azure resources deployed yet)
  → TCO Calculator ✅ (estimate migration costs)

Post-Migration:
  → Power BI App ✅ (analyze actual costs)
  → TCO Calculator ❌ (migration already complete)
```

**Example Scenario**:
```
App1 Migration Status: Planning Phase
Azure Resources: None deployed yet
Cost Data Available: $0 (nothing to analyze)

Power BI App Result:
  ❌ Cannot generate reports without data
  ❌ Cannot visualize costs that don't exist
  ❌ Cannot forecast migration costs

TCO Calculator Result:
  ✅ Estimates future Azure costs based on inputs
  ✅ Compares on-premises vs Azure
  ✅ Provides migration cost projections
```

**Conclusion**: The Power BI App is an excellent tool for visualizing and analyzing costs **after** resources are deployed, but it cannot estimate pre-migration costs for App1.

---

#### Key Takeaways

1. **TCO Calculator = Pre-Migration Cost Estimation**
   > Use the TCO Calculator to estimate compute costs and compare on-premises vs Azure costs before migrating

2. **Security and Compliance Included**
   > TCO Calculator factors in security and compliance benefits, making it suitable for scenarios with strict requirements

3. **Azure Advisor = Post-Deployment Optimization**
   > Azure Advisor provides recommendations for optimizing costs after resources are deployed, not before

4. **Power BI App = Post-Deployment Analysis**
   > The Power BI App visualizes and analyzes actual Azure spending, requiring deployed resources with cost data

5. **Migration Planning Tools vs Optimization Tools**
   ```
   Planning Phase (Pre-Migration):

---

**Conclusion**: Azure Boards is effective for project work tracking and agile methodologies but lacks direct features for comprehensive cost management and financial monitoring. For the specific requirement of monitoring costs on a per-project basis with minimal administrative effort, Azure Cost Management with tags and budgets is the appropriate solution.

---

#### Solution Architecture

**Recommended Implementation**:

```
Step 1: Define Tag Schema
Tags:
  - Project: ProjectA | ProjectB | ProjectC
  - Environment: Production | Development
  - CostCenter: CC-1001 | CC-1002 | CC-1003

Step 2: Apply Tags to Resources
Apply to all resources across 12 subscriptions:
  - VMs: Project=ProjectA
  - Databases: Project=ProjectA
  - Storage: Project=ProjectA
  
Use Azure Policy to enforce tagging

Step 3: Create Budgets per Project
Budget: ProjectA
  Scope: Subscription (or Management Group covering all 12)
  Filter: Tag "Project" equals "ProjectA"
  Amount: $20,000/month
  Alerts: 50%, 80%, 100%
  
Budget: ProjectB
  Scope: Subscription
  Filter: Tag "Project" equals "ProjectB"
  Amount: $15,000/month
  Alerts: 50%, 80%, 100%

Budget: ProjectC
  Scope: Subscription
  Filter: Tag "Project" equals "ProjectC"
  Amount: $10,000/month
  Alerts: 50%, 80%, 100%

Step 4: Monitor Costs
Cost Analysis:
  - Filter by Tag: Project=ProjectA
  - Group by: Service, Location, Resource Group
  - Time range: Last 30 days
  - Result: See ProjectA costs across all subscriptions

Step 5: Respond to Alerts
Budget alert received:
  → Review cost spike in Cost Analysis
  → Identify resource causing increase
  → Take action (optimize, scale down, or investigate)
```

**Benefits of This Solution**:
- ✅ **Minimal Administrative Effort**: Set up once, runs automatically
- ✅ **Cross-Subscription**: Works across all 12 subscriptions
- ✅ **Proactive Monitoring**: Alerts before cost overruns
- ✅ **Granular Visibility**: See costs per project, regardless of subscription
- ✅ **Scalable**: Easy to add new projects or subscriptions
- ✅ **Flexible**: Filter and group costs by multiple dimensions

---

#### Key Takeaways

1. **Resource Tags = Cost Allocation**
   > Tags enable logical grouping of resources for cost tracking across subscriptions and resource groups

2. **Budgets = Proactive Monitoring**
   > Budgets provide automated tracking and alerting for spending thresholds with minimal manual effort

3. **Tags + Budgets = Powerful Combination**
   > Filter budgets by tags to track costs for cross-cutting concerns like projects

4. **Management Groups ≠ Cost Tracking**
   > Management Groups are for governance and policy, not granular cost monitoring

5. **RBAC ≠ Cost Allocation**
   > RBAC controls access to cost data but doesn't enable cost tracking or allocation

6. **Workspace Control for Cost Optimization**
   > For services like Log Analytics, workspace-level settings (commitment tiers, retention) provide the most cost control

---

#### Related Concepts

**Cost Management Hierarchy**:
```
Management Group (Governance)
  └─ Subscription (Billing boundary)
      └─ Resource Group (Lifecycle boundary)
          └─ Resources (Tagged for cost allocation)
              └─ Cost Analysis (Filtered by tags)
                  └─ Budgets (Alert on thresholds)
```

**Cost Optimization Workflow**:
```
1. Tag all resources with Project identifier
2. Create budgets filtered by Project tag
3. Monitor costs in Cost Analysis grouped by tag
4. Receive budget alerts when thresholds reached
5. Review Azure Advisor recommendations
6. Optimize resources (right-size, reserved instances)
7. Export cost data for reporting
8. Repeat monthly
```

### Question 3: Minimizing Compute Costs for Production App Migration

**Scenario**:
Litware Inc. is migrating App1 to Azure. App1 is a long-running production application hosted on Ubuntu that must meet strict security and compliance requirements. The application will be hosted on dedicated Azure virtual machines.

You need to estimate the compute costs for App1 in Azure and minimize the costs while meeting security and compliance requirements.

**Question**: What should you implement to minimize the costs?

**Options**:
- A. Azure Reservations
- B. Azure Hybrid Benefit
- C. Azure Spot Virtual Machine pricing

**Correct Answer**: A (Azure Reservations)

---

#### Explanation

**Why Azure Reservations? ✅**

Azure Reservations is the correct choice for this scenario because:

1. **Long-Running Production Workload**: App1 is being migrated to Azure as a production application that will run continuously. Azure Reserved Instances (RIs) allow you to commit to 1-year or 3-year terms for virtual machines in exchange for **significant cost savings — up to 72%** compared to pay-as-you-go pricing.

2. **Predictable and Consistent Usage**: Production applications typically have predictable compute needs, making them ideal candidates for reserved capacity commitments.

3. **Security and Compliance Requirements**: Since App1 must meet **strict security and compliance requirements**, it needs guaranteed availability and dedicated resources. Azure Reservations provide:
   - ✅ Guaranteed capacity
   - ✅ Full SLA support
   - ✅ No interruption risk
   - ✅ Suitable for compliance workloads

4. **Dedicated Azure Virtual Machines**: The scenario explicitly states that App1 will be hosted on dedicated Azure VMs, which is perfect for Reservations that optimize VM costs.

5. **Cost Optimization for Predictable Workloads**: Reservations are designed specifically for steady-state workloads where you can forecast capacity needs, resulting in substantial savings without sacrificing availability.

**Reservation Benefits**:
```
Pay-as-you-go pricing: $730/month per VM (example D4s v3)
1-year reservation: $450/month → 38% savings
3-year reservation: $300/month → 59% savings

Annual savings (3-year): ($730 - $300) × 12 = $5,160 per VM

For multiple VMs:
10 VMs × $5,160 = $51,600 annual savings
```

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Up to 72% discount vs pay-as-you-go
- ✅ Guaranteed capacity and availability
- ✅ Meets compliance requirements
- ✅ Ideal for production workloads
- ✅ Flexible payment options (upfront, monthly)
- ✅ Can be exchanged or canceled (with restrictions)

---

**Why NOT Azure Hybrid Benefit? ❌**

Azure Hybrid Benefit is **incorrect** for this scenario because:

1. **Linux/Ubuntu Workload**: The case study states that App1 is **hosted on Ubuntu**, which is a Linux distribution. Azure Hybrid Benefit is **only available for**:
   - Windows Server workloads
   - SQL Server workloads
   - With active Software Assurance

2. **No License Reuse Indicated**: There is no mention in the scenario that Litware Inc. has existing Windows Server or SQL Server licenses to reuse.

3. **Not Applicable to Linux**: While there are separate programs for RHEL and SLES, standard Azure Hybrid Benefit does not apply to Ubuntu or most Linux distributions.

**Azure Hybrid Benefit Requirements**:
```
Supported:
✅ Windows Server Datacenter/Standard with Software Assurance
✅ SQL Server Enterprise/Standard with Software Assurance
✅ RedHat Enterprise Linux (separate RHEL benefit)
✅ SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (separate SUSE benefit)

Not Supported:
❌ Ubuntu
❌ CentOS
❌ Debian
❌ Other Linux distributions without specific agreements
```

**When Hybrid Benefit Would Apply**:
```
Scenario: Migrating Windows Server application with existing licenses

On-premises:
  └─ Windows Server 2019 Datacenter with Software Assurance

Azure Migration:
  └─ Apply Azure Hybrid Benefit → Save up to 40% on Windows VM costs
  └─ Combine with Reservations → Save up to 64% total

Result: Valid cost optimization strategy for Windows workloads
```

**Conclusion**: Since App1 runs on Ubuntu, Azure Hybrid Benefit cannot be used. Alternative cost optimization strategies like Azure Reservations are appropriate.

---

**Why NOT Azure Spot Virtual Machines? ❌**

Azure Spot VMs are **incorrect** for this scenario because:

1. **Production Workload**: App1 is a production application that requires consistent availability. Spot VMs are designed for **interruption-tolerant, non-production workloads** such as:
   - ✅ Batch processing jobs
   - ✅ Dev/test environments
   - ✅ Stateless applications
   - ✅ Background processing
   - ❌ Production apps with SLA requirements

2. **No Availability Guarantee**: Spot VMs can be **evicted with only 30 seconds notice** when Azure needs the capacity back or when the spot price exceeds your maximum price. This makes them unsuitable for:
   - ❌ Applications requiring high availability
   - ❌ Workloads with strict SLA requirements
   - ❌ Compliance-sensitive applications

3. **Compliance and Security Requirements**: The scenario explicitly states that App1 must meet **strict security and compliance requirements**. Spot VMs:
   - ❌ Provide no SLA guarantees
   - ❌ Cannot guarantee continuous availability
   - ❌ May be evicted during critical operations
   - ❌ Not suitable for compliance workloads

4. **Long-Running Workload**: The application is described as long-running, which means it needs to operate continuously without unexpected interruptions.

**Spot VM Characteristics**:
```
Pros:
✅ Up to 90% discount vs pay-as-you-go
✅ Great for interruptible workloads
✅ Cost-effective for batch jobs

Cons:
❌ Can be evicted with 30-second notice
❌ No availability SLA
❌ Not suitable for production apps
❌ Cannot meet compliance requirements
❌ Unpredictable availability
```

**Spot VM Eviction Scenarios**:
```
Capacity Eviction:
  Azure needs capacity → Spot VM evicted → 30-second notice
  
Price Eviction:
  Spot price > max price → VM evicted → 30-second notice

Impact on App1:
  ❌ Production service interrupted
  ❌ Potential data loss if not checkpointed
  ❌ Compliance violation (availability requirement)
  ❌ User-facing downtime
```

**When Spot VMs Would Be Appropriate**:
```
Scenario 1: Batch Data Processing
  └─ Job can be paused and resumed
  └─ No real-time requirements
  └─ Result: Spot VMs save 80-90% ✅

Scenario 2: Machine Learning Training
  └─ Checkpointing implemented
  └─ Can restart from checkpoint
  └─ Result: Spot VMs with GPU save massive costs ✅

Scenario 3: Dev/Test Environment
  └─ Non-production workload
  └─ Stateless test instances
  └─ Result: Spot VMs reduce dev/test costs ✅

Scenario 4: Production App (like App1)
  └─ Requires continuous availability
  └─ Must meet compliance requirements
  └─ Result: Spot VMs NOT suitable ❌
```

**Conclusion**: Spot VMs offer deep discounts but are fundamentally incompatible with the availability and compliance requirements of a production application like App1.

#### Cost Optimization Decision Matrix

| Requirement | Reservations | Hybrid Benefit | Spot VMs |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Long-running production** | ✅ Perfect fit | ❌ OS mismatch | ❌ No SLA |
| **Ubuntu workload** | ✅ Supported | ❌ Windows/SQL only | ✅ Supported |
| **Compliance required** | ✅ Full SLA | ✅ Full SLA | ❌ No guarantee |
| **Predictable usage** | ✅ Ideal | N/A | ❌ Eviction risk |
| **Cost savings** | ✅ Up to 72% | ✅ Up to 55% | ✅ Up to 90% |
| **Dedicated VMs** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Shared capacity |
| **Availability guarantee** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **App1 suitability** | ✅ **CORRECT** | ❌ Incorrect | ❌ Incorrect |

---

#### Solution Architecture

**Recommended Implementation for App1**:

```
Step 1: Size VMs Appropriately
  └─ Assess App1 requirements
  └─ Select appropriate VM SKU (e.g., D4s v3, E8s v3)
  └─ Determine quantity needed

Step 2: Purchase Azure Reservations
  └─ Choose term: 1-year or 3-year (3-year = max savings)
  └─ Payment option: Upfront, monthly, or no upfront
  └─ Scope: Subscription or Management Group
  └─ Region: Match App1 deployment region

Step 3: Deploy App1 to Azure
  └─ Provision VMs (Ubuntu)
  └─ Apply security and compliance configurations
  └─ Deploy application
  └─ Configure monitoring

Step 4: Monitor and Optimize
  └─ Track reservation utilization
  └─ Review Azure Advisor recommendations
  └─ Adjust sizing if needed
  └─ Consider auto-scaling for variable components

Cost Structure:
├─ Reserved VMs (baseline capacity): 72% savings
├─ Auto-scale VMs (peaks): Pay-as-you-go
└─ Storage, networking: Separate optimization
```

**Alternative Optimization Strategies for App1**:
```
✅ Right-size VMs based on actual usage
✅ Use managed disks with appropriate tier
✅ Implement auto-scaling for variable workload components
✅ Use Azure Monitor for performance optimization
✅ Schedule start/stop for non-production replicas
✅ Optimize storage with lifecycle policies
❌ Do NOT use Spot VMs for production instances
❌ Do NOT use Hybrid Benefit (Ubuntu not supported)
```

---

#### Key Takeaways

1. **Reservations = Production + Predictable Workloads**
   > Azure Reservations provide up to 72% savings for long-running production workloads with predictable capacity needs

2. **Hybrid Benefit = Windows/SQL Only**
   > Azure Hybrid Benefit applies only to Windows Server and SQL Server workloads with active Software Assurance, not Linux/Ubuntu

3. **Spot VMs = Interruptible Workloads Only**
   > Spot VMs offer massive discounts but lack availability guarantees, making them unsuitable for production apps with compliance requirements

4. **Compliance Requires Guaranteed Availability**
   > Security and compliance requirements typically demand SLAs and consistent availability, ruling out Spot VMs

5. **Multiple Strategies Can Coexist**
   ```
   Production Tier (App1 Core):
     └─ Azure Reservations (3-year) → 72% savings + guaranteed availability
   
   Background Processing:
     └─ Spot VMs (if stateless/restartable) → 90% savings
   
   Dev/Test Environments:
     └─ Spot VMs + auto-shutdown → 85%+ combined savings

**Cost Optimization Hierarchy**:
```
1. Right-size resources (Baseline efficiency)
   ├─ Use Azure Advisor recommendations
   └─ Monitor actual vs provisioned capacity

2. Choose pricing model (Strategic savings)
   ├─ Production: Reservations
   ├─ Windows migration: Hybrid Benefit
   └─ Batch/dev: Spot VMs

3. Implement auto-scaling (Dynamic optimization)
   ├─ Scale out for peaks
   └─ Scale in during off-hours

4. Monitor and adjust (Continuous improvement)
   ├─ Review monthly costs
   ├─ Adjust reservations as needed
   └─ Optimize based on usage patterns
```

**Migration Cost Optimization Workflow**:
```
Pre-Migration:
1. Assess workload characteristics
   └─ Production vs non-production
   └─ Steady vs variable load
   └─ Compliance requirements

2. Select pricing strategy
   └─ Reservations for production
   └─ Pay-as-you-go for unknown loads
   └─ Spot for dev/test

Migration:
3. Deploy with appropriate pricing
   └─ Purchase reservations if confident
   └─ Start with pay-as-you-go if uncertain

Post-Migration:
4. Monitor and optimize
   └─ Track actual usage
   └─ Purchase reservations once patterns clear
   └─ Adjust sizing based on performance
```
