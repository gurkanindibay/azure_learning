![Pull vs push models](images/img-057.jpeg)

There are two ways metrics data can be collected, pull or push. It is a
routine debate as to which one is better and there is no clear answer.
In this post, we will take a look at the pull model.

Figure 1 shows data collection with a pull model over HTTP. We have
dedicated metric collectors which pull metrics values from the running
applications periodically.
In this approach, the metrics collector needs to know the complete list
of service endpoints to pull data from. One naive approach is to use a
file to hold DNS/IP information for every service endpoint on the
“metric collector” servers. While the idea is simple, this approach is
hard to maintain in a large-scale environment where servers are added
or removed frequently, and we want to ensure that metric collectors
don’t miss out on collecting metrics from any new servers.
The good news is that we have a reliable, scalable, and maintainable
solution available through Service Discovery, provided by Kubernetes,
Zookeeper, etc., wherein services register their availability and the
metrics collector can be notified by the Service Discovery component
whenever the list of service endpoints changes. Service discovery
contains configuration rules about when and where to collect metrics
as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 3 explains the pull model in detail.
1️⃣ The metrics collector fetches configuration metadata of service
endpoints from Service Discovery. Metadata include pulling interval, IP
addresses, timeout and retries parameters, etc.
2️⃣ The metrics collector pulls metrics data via a pre-defined HTTP
endpoint (for example, /metrics). To expose the endpoint, a client
library usually needs to be added to the service. In Figure 3, the
service is Web Servers.
3️⃣ Optionally, the metrics collector registers a change event notification
with Service Discovery to receive an update whenever the service
endpoints change. Alternatively, the metrics collector can poll for
endpoint changes periodically.
